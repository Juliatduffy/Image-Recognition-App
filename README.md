# Image-Recognition-App

This app is able to classify five different classes of fruit: apples, bananas, grapes, oranges, and strawberries. The user can choose to take a picture in the app or upload an image from their camera roll. I built the image classification using TensorFlow, and the App using Android and Kotlin. I collected the training images using a short web-crawling script I built in Python with the iCrawler library.
